### Hello!

My name is Nayare Soledad and I am an AI developer and python programmer. I studied Fine Arts between 2015 and 2019 and immersed myself in the field of culture for some time, learning to communicate, empathize and learn about collective work as a powerful and creative tool. In the last year I've been training in technological tools focusing on AI and its applications in the context we live now. I hope to continue learning from many of the communities that make up this world, including the GitHub community and continue to improve my skills to be able to offer better solutions. Thanks for being here and welcome.
